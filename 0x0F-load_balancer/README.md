| `0. Double the number of webservers` | In this first task we need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, we built a Bash script during oour web server project, and they’ll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate our work! |
| `1. Install your load balancer`| Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server. |
| `2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet` | Just as in task #0, we’d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet. |
